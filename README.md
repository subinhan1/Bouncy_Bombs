# Bouncy_Bombs
A game using pygame and pymunk

This is a project that aims to create a defense game using simulations of bouncing bombs using pygame and pymunk's rigid body physics library. 

Adjust the initial launch angle of the bomb using the arrow keys, adjust the strength of the launch by holding down the space bar, and detonate the bombs by pressing the enter/return key.
